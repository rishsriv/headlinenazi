A simple web-app to critique and vote on headlines

HeadlineNazi is an attempt to make headlines around the world better. This is partially done through a headline rating system, which is live at headlinenazi.appspot.com. This repo contains the code for the aforementioned app.

The code is rather limited and messy right now. This will be fixed as the project matures.
